relationships between SalePrice and features such as OverallQual,
GrLivArea, GarageArea, and TotalBsmtSF. OverallQual has the highest
correlation with SalePrice, indicating that better construction quality
significantly increases house value. Pairwise plots further confirm strong
linear relationships between living area and sale price. Negative or weak
